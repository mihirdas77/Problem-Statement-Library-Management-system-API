# Library Management System API

## Overview

This is a RESTful API for a Library Management System built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. The API allows users to manage books, authors, members, and borrowing transactions while implementing user authentication and role-based access control.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login with JWT
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Admin and Member roles
- **Manage Entities:** Books, Authors, Members, Borrowing Transactions
- **Borrowing History:** View borrowing history for members

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Password Security:** Bcrypt for hashing passwords
